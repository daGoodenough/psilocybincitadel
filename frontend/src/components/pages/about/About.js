      <h1>About Psitadel</h1>
      <p>
        A portmanteau of Psilocybin Citadel, Psitadel is a safe ground for
        psychedelic exploration utilizing the Bitcoin network.{' '}
      </p>
      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        Formed online in 2023, Psitadel is an open-source DAO (decentralized
        autonomous organization) to advocate for mental well-being with
        psychedelic education facilitating direct access to entheogenic
        medicines in a self-sovereign and responsible manner.{' '}
      </p>
      <p>
        The importance of cultural acceptance and rewriting of baseless stigma
        is foundational to these ends.
      </p>
      <p>
        Equally paramount is our belief that utilizing the Bitcoin network,
        which shares a fundamental structure of decentralization and autonomy,
        will highlight the parallel necessity for economic and social reform.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our Mission is to facilitate real-world gatherings to promote the use of
        tools which allow the holistic healing of societyâ€™s ills regarding
        mental, physical, spiritual, social, and financial health.
      </p>
      <h2>Funding</h2>

        mycelial networks of digital, financial, physical, and human
        connections.

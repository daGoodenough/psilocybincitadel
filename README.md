# Psilocybin Citadel

### Our mission is to facilitate real-world gatherings to promote the use of tools which allow the healing of societyâ€™s sicknesses regarding mental, physical, spiritual, social, and financial health.

### Some tools we use to achieve this are

1. Psilocybin (psycho-spiritual)

2. Bitcoin (Socio-financial)

   ***
Mycelium <em>(plural mycelia) is a root-like structure of a fungus consisting of a mass of branching, thread-like hyphae.

A mycelium may be minute, forming a colony that is too small to see, or may grow to span thousands of acres. We aim to model the growth and behavior of this "Psitadel" after that of mycelium.</em>

## Getting Started:

The frontend website is built using React.

1. Make sure you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) installed on your local machine. Use the LTS.
